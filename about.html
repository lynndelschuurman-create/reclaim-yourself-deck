  <h1>Heart of Receiving</h1>

  <p>I created <strong>Heart of Receiving</strong> as a sanctuary for women who are done performing for love, success, or belonging.<br>
  For years, I lived in the tension between control and surrender - holding everything together, yet feeling disconnected from my own heart. Healing taught me that the medicine isn’t in doing more, but in allowing more.</p>

  <p>Here, I bring together everything that changed me: the poetry that gave language to my ache, the cards that offered gentle guidance when I felt lost, and the rituals that helped me soften into my body again.</p>

  <p>Through <strong>Heart of Receiving</strong>, I hold space for women to return to themselves - to rewrite their relationship with worth, money, and softness. It’s not about striving or fixing. It’s about remembering. About becoming the woman who no longer abandons herself to be loved, seen, or chosen.</p>

  <p>This space is my offering - a gathering of truth, ritual, and reclamation. This space is for every woman who is ready to open her heart and receive what was always meant for her.</p>
